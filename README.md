In the GCD_main.cpp file: The function gcd(m,n) recursively computes the greatest common divisor of two positive
integers m and n and returns the result as an integer. If either (or both) of the inputs is less than or equal
to 0, the function returns zero to indicate invalid input.


In the SERIES_main.cpp file: The function Series(n) recursively computes the value of the series âˆ‘(2n)/(3n+2) from initial value 1 to n.
